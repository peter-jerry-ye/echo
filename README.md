# Echo

## Introduction

This is a project that simulates the game ["Dark Echo"](www.darkechogame.com).  
The purpose of the application is to practise collision detection and space indexing.  

The application contains a map which is predifined and consists of walls. The user can use mouse to choose a point to make "sounds", to emit particals toward multiple directions. These particles will bounce if it hits a wall.

This application will have multiple implementations of the map, and by varying the number of walls, the number of particles and the lifespan of particles, we can compare the performances of these implementations.
